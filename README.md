# English Premier League Oracle

# Overview
This project focuses on utilizing the Random Forest Classifier machine learning algorithm to predict match outcomes in the English Premier League for the 2022-2023 season. By training the model on historical match data and relevant features, the aim is to forecast whether a match will result in a win for the home team, a win for the away team, or a draw.

# Motivation
The primary motivation behind this project is to explore the effectiveness of the Random Forest Classifier in predicting match outcomes in one of the world's most popular football leagues. Accurate predictions can provide valuable insights to fans, analysts, and even betting enthusiasts. The project also aims to enhance understanding of machine learning techniques and their application to real-world scenarios.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of historical match data from previous 5 English Premier League seasons (from the 2022-2023 season). The dataset includes features such as team rankings, player statistics, match location, and more. The data is split into training and testing sets to train and evaluate the model's performance.

# Methodology
Data Collection: Historical match data is collected from reliable sources, cleaned, and preprocessed to extract relevant features.

Feature Engineering: Features such as team rankings, recent form, player performance, and match location are engineered to capture relevant information.

Model Building: A Random Forest Classifier is chosen as the machine learning model. The model is trained on the training dataset, where it learns to predict match outcomes based on the provided features.

Model Evaluation: The trained model is evaluated using the testing dataset. Metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated to assess the model's performance.

Prediction: The trained model is then used to predict match outcomes for the 2022-2023 season using the available data.
